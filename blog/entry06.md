# Entry 6
##### 6/2/24

Making a good presentation for a big project was actually a lot more difficult than I thought. It's pretty much impossible to explain every line of code, what it does, and why it does it. It wouldn't even be feasible to summarize each part. I had to hone in on the most important stuff, and even then I'd end up having to gloss over a bunch of code.

The best way to decide what I would explain in my presentation was by evaluating what were the MVP and non-MVP features. Nobody really cares about a loading screen; It wouldn't be very relevant to my project either. However, I would absolutely have to explain how I used physics to make a nucleus model.

The [general plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_t1m0m0vUGzBEhFIIDHmVApf5_VBdPcQBoo364VQYk8/edit#heading=h.361vsvlrx00t) for what I want to go over was:
* The algorithm that I used in order to generate a multi-dimensional electron structure.
* Physics to position the neutrons and protons in the nucleus.
* OOP concepts to organize components of my project.
* Trigonometry to position electrons.

Oh, and of course I had to include the line number of the code too. That subtle pretentiousness is really important.

The harder task would end up being providing context behind why I took the approaches that I used. One of the biggest ordeals of the project was figuring out how I was going to structure my electrons in the first place. And this would require me to go over some basic chemistry concepts, such as the Aufbau Principle and electron configurations. You know, stuff you'd probably hear about in your first Chemistry 101 lecture. It wasn't THAT deep. For example, when explaining the algorithm behind the structuring of my electrons, I explained the goal that I wanted to accomplish, introduced some concepts with some visuals that would help the audience understand why they were relevant to what I needed to do, and then explained how I actually implemented it. In my opinion, this worked pretty well, but I still did end up having to improvise a bit. At the last minute, I thought that I didn't have enough context for the audience to understand what I was saying. So that's one thing I need to revise about my slides before I present at the finalist showcase.

In the end, I ended up including [a lot](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1abC4FaHfnqwgbTg5e0iv9zr_ohOlVG3bXfWrQXsEVJ8/edit?usp=sharing) of visuals and labels. Many big chunks of code as well simply because it's just not possible to condense it. Much of the code that I went over actually wasn't really exclusive to the tools that I used most of the time and had very little jargon, which fortunately made it easier for the average person to understand. The other advantage of doing that was that I only needed to introduce some very brief context about Three.js and Cannon.js, because ultimately my presentation revolves around the final product, not the tools that I used to make it. 

As for the [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_t1m0m0vUGzBEhFIIDHmVApf5_VBdPcQBoo364VQYk8/edit#heading=h.uleqo0zcryhs), I wanted to especially focus on the product I made. I started by explaining that my project was a 3D atomic simulation and introducing its features, then its actual purpose. I wanted to emphasize that this was a very practical app that could be used by people at all levels of familiarity with chemistry. I don't actually know what the judges thought about it, but figure that it must've worked. I don't really think that there's anything to improve on in terms of the pitch. I'll probably do something similar as well next year.

I'm currently working on the skills consideration and creativity. In order to present my project I had to focus on what it would do and how it would help others. Also, to make my project creative, I decided to choose an idea that would both have a usage in the real world (besides purely for entertainment purposes) and interesting as well. 

I'm currently at the 8th and last stage of the engineering design process. At this point I have a completed project that I now have to present to others.
