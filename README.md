# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Austin Liu**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Three.js** and **Cannon.js** in order to help me make a 3D atomic model app.

## Implications
##### PROS
* If you're unfamiliar with chemistry, you can use this as a tool to learn something new.
* If you're already familiar with chemistry, you can use this as a reference for information about an element.
* The product is very user friendly. If you want to view a model for an element, all you need to know is its name. From there, you can toggle the type of information you want displayed with the menu. This way teachers can use it as well for their classrooms. The information displayed is toggleable, so teachers and students can adjust the app to suit the scope of their learning.

##### CONS
* Not everyone likes chemistry :(
* There is some lack of context that might make it a bit confusing for someone who doesn't know much chemistry.
